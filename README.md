A mod for ARMA3 that adds compatibility between the ACRE2 mod and the IFA3 mod for vehicle radios, intercoms, and infantry phones.

More specifically, it sets the radios up in a more historical manner than the default configs that ACRE2 provides.

The aim is not to provide 100% historical fidelity, concessions have been made to gameplay in some instances.

For example:

Tanks all have infantry telephones with interaction points in reasonably plausible positions at the rear of the vehicle.

Tanks all have crew intercoms to ensure that loud vehicle audio doesn't impede crew communication due to Teamspeak and in game audio balance.

For vehicles with crew intercoms, radio Rx/Tx is usually available for all crew members over the intercom.

This means that you won't be forced to have a player in the radio operators seat all the time, and that tanks can be effectively crewed with a minimum number of players for smaller ARMA groups.

The correct radio operator seat must still be used to access the radio GUI and change radio frequencies.
